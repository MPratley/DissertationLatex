% what we know of its function is experimentally determined, not calculated from
% the sequence. It would be wonderful to be able to take a sequence, plug it into
% a computer, and have it spit back a quantitative assessment of all of its
% interactions with other proteins, but we can't do that, and even if we could, it
% wouldn't answer all the questions we'd have about its function, because we'd
% also need to know the state of all of the proteins in the cell, and the state of
% all of the proteins in adjacent cells, and the state of global and local
% signaling proteins in the environment.
