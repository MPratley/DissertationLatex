\section{Simulation Requirements}

While there are many different levels of emulation possible in the field of
computational neuroscience, for the purposes of this dissertation, a spiking
neural network is appropriate. This allows inserting error into the system that
is equivalent to imaging error in both neurons and synapses when constructing
connectomes from EM images. It is, however, not necessary to precisely emulate
the chemical processes within the nervous system and these processes may be
mathematically approximated. The following are the software requirements of the
simulation that I have developed for the research purposes of this dissertation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Use a clock-driven model for Simulation} where time interval
          is small enough to minimise descritization errors.

    \item \textbf{Support some form of plasticity between neurons.} This should
          be capable of performing weight updates in an unsupervised manner manner
          across the network.

    \item \textbf{Simulation should be easily configurable at runtime using parameters}
    \item \textbf{Should be easy to define large groups of neurons with individual parameters drawn from probability distributions}
    \item \textbf{Should be capable of probabilistically creating synapses between neuron groups}
    \item \textbf{Experiments performed with the simulation must be repeatable}
          hence the stochastic element of network generation should be seed-able so
          networks can be recreated.
    \item \textbf{Network should support an optional stochastic input to emulate noise}
    \item \textbf{Networks should be duplicable using standard Python techniques}
    \item \textbf{It would be desirable for separate simulations to have the
              capability to run in parallel} This requires creating computation pools due
          to the limits of the Global Process Lock in the python interpreter.
