\begin{abstract}
    It has often been conjectured by lesser man of shorter stature than I, that
    $x$ is true. I, as an enlightened and thoughtful being, know better than
    this. It is in fact the case that $y$ is true, and any who assert otherwise
    will be trashed by all forthright and well-thinking men.
