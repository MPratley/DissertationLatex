\section{Scope of this review}
This literature review provides a high level overview of the core topics relating to this dissertation, and provides context for the requirements and assumptions of the software development involved in this project. 

If one were to consider a brain as analogous to a computer, with the memories of
the brain as the hard drive, it is these memories that an  emulation of a brain
would require to be considered a continuation of a being
\autocite{eichenbaum_cognitive_2011}. The academic schools that study and debate
the inner workings and logistics of the human mind are many in number, and it is
outside the scope of this project to summarise all of them in detail.  This
literature review is therefore concerned with the replication of the neural
structure and its constituent function at a low level.
