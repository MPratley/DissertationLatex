\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Reflection on personal objectives}

Over the course of researching, developing and writing this dissertation, I've
encountered many ideas, schools of thought, and applications of maths and
computer science that were abstract or unknown to me previously. In choosing a
dissertation that is rooted in computational neuroscience, a topic that is
conceptually new to me, my primary aim was to develop an original understanding
of the limitations that current imaging technology poses to the feasibility of
emulating the whole human brain. 

Throughout the process of creating this dissertation, I have refined my own
researching skills, and am now comfortable synthesising many sources covering a
topic to improve my own understanding, something that I did not have much
practice of beforehand. I've now learned how to effectively cross-reference
hypotheses and conclusions between several, often differing, studies and to
examine as many types of evidence as I can find.



\section{Result reflections and future work}

It seems likely that synaptic plasticity is the key to running simulations of
imperfectly created models that contain error, particularly in synapses where
the precise details of placement and physical composition must be resolved at
the scale of nanometres when imaging. If this is the case, then any future
technology that aims to emulate, and even predict, brain activity must ensure
that its underlying simulation is capable of capturing the nuances of synaptic
plasticity. 

While I believe that the results shown in this dissertation are meaningful, they
do not exclude other interpretations or hypotheses, and there is a lot of work
to be done to better understand the opportunities, potential exploitation, and
limitations of simulation and the requirements of models to be simulated.

Future work should investigate the effect of different Hebbian-Learning models
when applying error to a simulated model, and whether inhibitory synapses have a
similar compensatory effect as excitatory synapses have been shown to in this
dissertation. It could be the case that inhibitory synapses with plasticity have
an effect whereby the equilibrium reached in the network is less stable and
prone to increased deviation from measurement error.

\subsection{Improvements in the project}

Certain concepts were intractable for quite some time while other concepts that I considered understood made little sense when the time came to
expand and on them for practical application. The time taken to build the
required understanding in the several constituent schools of computational
neuroscience meant that it was difficult appropriately set the scope of the
project in its infancy. However, through conversations with peers and my own
research, this [was overcome?] TODO

While further work needs to be taken to understand how larger networks
might behave with this imaging error, I believe that the work described in this
document is both original and TODO

\subsection{Success in the project}

Personally proud of the software that has been developed for this dissertation,
and progress that I've made in a short time-frame, particularly with highly
disruptive external pressures in the final weeks of the project. I've found the
marriage of the moral, philosophical and technical concepts that surround brain
simulation to be immensely thought provoking.
