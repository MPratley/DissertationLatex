\section{Imaging and Image Processing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prediction of future brain activity through simulation requires an accurate and detailed connectome of a brain, with synapses and neurons correctly located in space.\autocite{bostrom_whole_2008}
    \item The accuracy of such a model depends on the resolution of the imaging method used to create it. The error resulting from such a imaging method is the \textbf{measurement error}. 
    \item Depending on imaging procedure, brain matter may shift in composition during the course of the scan, which is the cause of \textbf{measurement drift}, itself a form of measurement error.
\end{itemize}

(this is easy just print something out
and scan it badly. Explain what kind of error in incurred.)
