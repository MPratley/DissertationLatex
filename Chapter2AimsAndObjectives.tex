\chapter{Aims and Objectives}
My project aims to demonstrate the effect of measurement error on brain simulation by developing tooling and adapting the VERTEX simulator. The outcome of this project will be to improve the tooling available to run parallel simulations which diverge at chosen points throughout the runtime of a brain simulation, with new parameters at the point of divergence. These parameters will then be modified to model the effect of measurement error when “uploading” a brain into a simulation.
