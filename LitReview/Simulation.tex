This article describes the implementation of new functionality in the VERTEX
simulator, providing the option of modelling brain simulation techniques such as
paired pulse depression and long term potentiation. This was achieved by making
changes to the synapse model in VERTEX so that weights between connections could
be updated over time (plasticity). This paper provides a primary reference for
editing the VERTEX source code and the internal structure of the model. This
will help form a clearer picture of what development needs to happen to achieve
my project aim.
