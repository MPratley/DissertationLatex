We start by reviewing the different types of simulation strategies and algorithms that are currently implemented. We next review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin–Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural networks.},

In The Computational Brain, Patricia Churchland and Terrence Sejnowski developed a different conceptual framework, based on large populations of neurons. They did this by showing that patterns of activities among the units in trained artificial neural network models had properties that resembled those recorded from populations of neurons recorded one at a time. It is one of the first books to bring together computational concepts and behavioral data within a neurobiological framework. Aimed at a broad audience of neuroscientists, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, The Computational Brain is written for both expert and novice. This anniversary edition offers a new preface by the authors that puts the book in the context of current research.This approach influenced a generation of researchers. Even today, when neuroscientists can routinely record from hundreds of neurons using optics rather than electricity, and the 2013 White House BRAIN initiative heralded a new era in innovative neurotechnologies, the main message of The Computational Brain is still relevant.},

A user study comparing the usability of the factory pattern and constructors in API designs found highly significant results indicating that factories are detrimental to API usability in several varied situations. The results showed that users require significantly more time (p = 0.005) to construct an object with a factory than with a constructor while performing both context-sensitive and context-free tasks. These results suggest that the use of factories can and should be avoided in many cases where other techniques, such as constructors or class clusters, can be used instead.},

Harm and not invasiveness is the metric by which to measure the ethical permissibility of research. Because of a class of harms to minds and selves, special attention should be paid to value considerations. These considerations need to be addressed by researchers, funders, and review boards to create proper safeguards from conception of research through final application of results.},

field potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal
activity in both research and clinical applications. Proper understanding
of the LFP requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the
anatomical and electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording
electrode, as well as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we
propose a hybrid modeling scheme combining efficient point-neuron network
models with biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by real
neurons. The LFP predictions rely on populations of network-equivalent
multicompartment neuron models with layer-specific synaptic connectivity,
can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron network populations,
and allows for a full separation of simulated network dynamics and LFPs.
We apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a ∼1 mm2
patch of primary visual cortex, predict laminar LFPs for different network
states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different laminar
populations, and investigate effects of input correlations and neuron
density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its public
implementation in hybridLFPy form the basis for LFP predictions from other
and larger point-neuron network models, as well as extensions of the
current application with additional biological detail.},

Perceptions of social isolation, or loneliness, increase vigilance for threat and heighten feelings of vulnerability while also raising the desire to reconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for social threat alters psychological processes that influence physiological functioning, diminish sleep quality, and increase morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this paper is to review the features and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive theoretical framework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness. We review physical and mental health consequences of loneliness, mechanisms for its effects, and effectiveness of extant interventions. Features of a loneliness regulatory loop are employed to explain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness. Loneliness is not simply being alone. Interventions to reduce loneliness and its health consequences may need to take into account its attentional, confirmatory, and memorial biases as well as its social and behavioral effects.},

  abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNN) have gained popularity in embedded applications such as robotics and computer vision. The main advantages of SNN are the temporal plasticity, ease of use in neural interface circuits and reduced computation complexity. SNN have been successfully used for image classification. They provide a model for the mammalian visual cortex, image segmentation and pattern recognition. Different spiking neuron mathematical models exist, but their computational complexity makes them ill-suited for hardware implementation. In this paper, a novel, simplified and computationally efficient model of spike response model (SRM) neuron with spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) learning is presented. Frequency spike coding based on receptive fields is used for data representation; images are encoded by the network and processed in a similar manner as the primary layers in visual cortex. The network output can be used as a primary feature extractor for further refined recognition or as a simple object classifier. Results show that the model can successfully learn and classify black and white images with added noise or partially obscured samples with up to ×20 computing speed-up at an equivalent classification ratio when compared to classic SRM neuron membrane models. The proposed solution combines spike encoding, network topology, neuron membrane model and STDP learning.},

How is such demand met by neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which plays a fundamental role in episodic memory formation? We recorded the activity of MTL neurons in neurosurgical patients while they learned new associations. Pairs of unrelated pictures, one of a person and another of a place, were used to construct a meaningful association modeling the episodic memory of meeting a person in a particular place. We found that a large proportion of responsive MTL neurons expanded their selectivity to encode these specific associations within a few trials: cells initially responsive to one picture started firing to the associated one but not to others. Our results provide a plausible neural substrate for the inception of associations, which are crucial for the formation of episodic memories.},

A survey of the research on emotional trauma, learning, memory loss, glucocosteroid stress hormones, and the hippocampus was conducted, and animal and human studies were reviewed. It is well documented and has been experimentally demonstrated in animals and humans that prolonged and high levels of stress, fear, and arousal commonly induce learning deficits and memory loss ranging from the minimal to the profound. As stress and arousal levels dramatically increase, learning and memory deteriorate in accordance with the classic inverse U-shaped curve. These memory deficits are due to disturbances in hippocampal activation and arousal, and the corticosteroid secretion, which can suppress neural activity associated with learning and memory and induce hippocampal atrophy. Risk and predisposing factors include a history of previous emotional trauma or neurological injury involving the temporal lobe and hippocampus, the repetitive and prolonged nature of the trauma (i.e., sexual abuse), and age and individual differences in baseline arousal and level of cortisol.

These technical advances are of special importance to the field of neuroanatomy, as 3D reconstructions of neuronal processes at the nm scale can provide new insight into the fine grained structure of the brain. Segmentation of large-scale electron microscopy data is the main bottleneck in the analysis of these data sets. In this paper we present a pipeline that provides state-of-the art reconstruction performance while scaling to data sets in the GB-TB range. First, we train a random forest classifier on interactive sparse user annotations. The classifier output is combined with an anisotropic smoothing prior in a Conditional Random Field framework to generate multiple segmentation hypotheses per image. These segmentations are then combined into geometrically consistent 3D objects by segmentation fusion. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the automatic segmentation and demonstrate large-scale 3D reconstructions of neuronal processes from a 27,000μm3 volume of brain tissue over a cube of 30μm in each dimension corresponding to 1000 consecutive image sections. We also introduce Mojo, a proofreading tool including semi-automated correction of merge errors based on sparse user scribbles.},

  abstract = {Neural network research often builds on the fiction that neurons are simple linear threshold units, completely neglecting the highly dynamic and complex nature of synapses, dendrites, and voltage-dependent ionic currents. Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons challenges this notion, using richly detailed experimental and theoretical findings from cellular biophysics to explain the repertoire of computational functions available to single neurons. The author shows how individual nerve cells can multiply, integrate, or delay synaptic inputs and how information can be encoded in the voltage across the membrane, in the intracellular calcium concentration, or in the timing of individual spikes. Key topics covered include the linear cable equation; cable theory as applied to passive dendritic trees and dendritic spines; chemical and electrical synapses and how to treat them from a computational point of view; nonlinear interactions of synaptic input in passive and active dendritic trees; the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation and propagation; phase space analysis; linking stochastic ionic channels to membrane-dependent currents; calcium- and potassium-currents and their role in information processing; the role of diffusion, buffering and binding of calcium, and other messenger systems in information processing and storage; short- and long-term models of synaptic plasticity; simplified models of single cells; stochastic aspects of neuronal firing; the nature of the neuronal code; and unconventional models of sub-cellular computation. Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons serves as an ideal text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in cellular biophysics, computational neuroscience, and neural networks, and will appeal to students and professionals in neuroscience, electrical and computer engineering, and physics.},

These collections of network data and associated metadata, analyzed using tools from graph theory and classification theory, can be merged with classical systems theory, giving a more completely parameterized view of how biologic information processing systems are implemented in retina and brain. Networks have two separable features: topology and connection attributes. The first findings from connectomics strongly validate the idea that the topologies of complete retinal networks are far more complex than the simple schematics that emerged from classical anatomy. In particular, connectomics has permitted an aggressive refactoring of the retinal inner plexiform layer, demonstrating that network function cannot be simply inferred from stratification; exposing the complex geometric rules for inserting different cells into a shared network; revealing unexpected bidirectional signaling pathways between mammalian rod and cone systems; documenting selective feedforward systems, novel candidate signaling architectures, new coupling motifs, and the highly complex architecture of the mammalian AII amacrine cell. This is but the beginning, as the underlying principles of connectomics are readily transferrable to non-neural cell complexes and provide new contexts for assessing intercellular communication.},

An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 ± 0.01 mm\textsuperscript{3} containing ∼31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form ∼8 million connections with ∼37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}PaperClip{$<$}/h3{$><$}h3{$>$}Video Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$}},

  abstract = {Personality change due to traumatic brain injury (PC) in children is an important psychiatric complication of injury and is a form of severe affective dysregulation. This study aimed to examine neurocognitive correlates of PC. The sample included 177 children 5–14 years old with traumatic brain injury who were enrolled from consecutive admissions to five trauma centers. Patients were followed up prospectively at baseline and at 6 months, and they were assessed with semistructured psychiatric interviews. Injury severity, socioeconomic status, and neurocognitive function (measures of attention, processing speed, verbal memory, IQ, verbal working memory, executive function, naming/reading, expressive language, motor speed, and motor inhibition) were assessed with standardized instruments. Unremitted PC was present in 26 (18\%) of 141 participants assessed at 6 months postinjury. Attention, processing speed, verbal memory, IQ, and executive function were significantly associated with PC even after socioeconomic status, injury severity, and preinjury attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were controlled. These findings are a first step in characterizing concomitant cognitive impairments associated with PC. The results have implications beyond brain injury to potentially elucidate the neurocognitive symptom complex associated with mood instability regardless of etiology.},

However, at that time sample preparation, imaging methods and computational tools were either nonexistent or insufficiently developed to permit the precise mapping of an entire brain with all of its neurons and their connections. Some measure of the “mesoscopic” connectional organization of the mammalian brain has been obtained over the past decade by alignment of sparse subsets of labeled neurons onto a reference atlas or via MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging. Neither method, however, provides data on the complete connectivity of all neurons comprising an individual brain. Fortunately, whole-brain cellular connectomics now appears within reach due to recent advances in whole-brain sample preparation and high-throughput electron microscopy, though substantial obstacles remain with respect to large volume electron microscopic acquisitions and automated neurite reconstructions. This perspective examines the current status and problems associated with generating a mammalian whole-brain cellular connectome and argues that the time is right to launch a concerted connectomic attack on a small mammalian whole-brain.},

  abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for learning and memory. Considerable attention has been paid to mechanisms that increase or decrease synaptic efficacy, referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively. It is becoming apparent that synaptic activity also modulates the ability to elicit subsequent synaptic changes. We provide direct experimental evidence that this modulation is attributable, at least in part, to variations in the level of postsynaptic depolarization required for inducing plasticity. In slices from adult hippocampal CA1, a brief pairing protocol known to produce LTP can also induce LTD. The voltage–response function for the induction of LTD and LTP in naive synapses exhibits three parts: at a postsynaptic membrane potential during pairing (Vm) ≤ −40 mV, no synaptic modification is obtained; at Vmbetween −40 and −20 mV, LTD is induced; and, finally, atVm {$>$} −20 mV, LTP is generated. This function varies with initial synaptic efficacy. In depressed synapses, Θ−, the Vm above which LTD is generated, is shifted toward more depolarizedVms and Θ+, the LTD–LTP crossover point or, equivalently, the Vmabove which LTP is induced, toward more polarizedVms. Conversely in potentiated synapses, Θ− is shifted toward more polarizedVms. Therefore synaptic activity changes synaptic efficacy and accordingly adjusts the voltages for eliciting subsequent synaptic modifications. The concomitant shifts in the voltages for inducing LTD and LTP in opposite directions promote synaptic potentiation and inhibit synaptic depression in depressed synapses and vice versa in potentiated synapses.},

  abstract = {Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient’s virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.},

Refinements to the code completion menu that incorporate additional sources of information have similarly been shown to be valuable, even relative to standalone counterparts offering similar functionality. In this paper, we describe active code completion, an architecture that allows library developers to introduce interactive and highly-specialized code generation interfaces, called palettes, directly into the editor. Using several empirical methods, we examine the contexts in which such a system could be useful, describe the design constraints governing the system architecture as well as particular code completion interfaces, and design one such system, named Graphite, for the Eclipse Java development environment. Using Graphite, we implement a palette for writing regular expressions as our primary example and conduct a small pilot study. In addition to showing the feasibility of this approach, it provides further evidence in support of the claim that integrating specialized code completion interfaces directly into the editor is valuable to professional developers.},

Algorithms designed to automate image segmentation suffer from substantial error rates and require significant manual error correction. Any improvement in segmentation error rates would therefore directly reduce the time required to analyze 3D EM data. We explored preserving extracellular space (ECS) during chemical tissue fixation to improve the ability to segment neurites and to identify synaptic contacts. ECS preserved tissue is easier to segment using machine learning algorithms, leading to significantly reduced error rates. In addition, we observed that electrical synapses are readily identified in ECS preserved tissue. Finally, we determined that antibodies penetrate deep into ECS preserved tissue with only minimal permeabilization, thereby enabling correlated light microscopy (LM) and EM studies. We conclude that preservation of ECS benefits multiple aspects of the connectomic analysis of neural circuits.},

Second, they are robust to outlier noise and quantization effects. Third, they are metrics.

We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency–current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

Additionally, they exhibit complex multilevel and plastic behaviors, which make them good candidates for the implementation of artificial synapses in neuromorphic engineering. However, memristive effects rely on diverse physical mechanisms, and their plastic behaviors differ strongly from one technology to another. Here, we present measurements performed on different memristive devices and the opportunities that they provide. We show that they can be used to implement different learning rules whose properties emerge directly from device physics: real time or accelerated operation, deterministic or stochastic behavior, long term or short term plasticity. We then discuss how such devices might be integrated into a complete architecture. These results highlight that there is no unique way to exploit memristive devices in neuromorphic systems. Understanding and embracing device physics is the key for their optimal use.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an area-efficient mixed-signal implementation of synapse-based long term plasticity realized in a VLSI1 model of a spiking neural network. The artificial synapses are based on an implementation of spike time dependent plasticity (STDP). In the biological specimen, STDP is a mechanism acting locally in each synapse. The presented electronic implementation succeeds in maintaining this high level of parallelism and simultaneously achieves a synapse density of more than 9k synapses per mm2 in a 180 nm technology. This allows the construction of neural micro-circuits close to the biological specimen while maintaining a speed several orders of magnitude faster than biological real time. The large acceleration factor enhances the possibilities to investigate key aspects of plasticity, e.g. by performing extensive parameter searches.},

Two examples will be considered. First, the optimism observed at a transhumanist event will be examined to emphasize the positive affective aspects of certain apocalypse scenarios, especially those with an implicit eschatological direction. Second, an online location where examples of existential despair can be noted will be explored further to demonstrate the kinds of negative responses to certain superintelligence/singularity ideas. These examples of existential hope and despair will demonstrate the intrinsic role of anxiety in ideas about a future artificial intelligence apocalypse.},

  abstract = {Floating-point divide and square-root operations are essential to many scientific and engineering applications, and are required in all computer systems that support the IEEE floating-point standard. Yet many current microprocessors provide only weak support for these operations. The latency and throughput of division are typically far inferior to those of floating-point addition and multiplication, and square-root performance is often even lower. This article argues the case for high-performance division and square root. It also explains the algorithms and implementations of the primary techniques, subtractive and multiplicative methods, employed in microprocessor floating-point units with their associated area/performance tradeoffs. Case studies of representative floating-point unit configurations are presented, supported by simulation results using a carefully selected benchmark, Givens rotation, to show the dynamic performance impact of the various implementation alternatives. The topology of the implementation is found to be an important performance factor. Multiplicative algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson method and Goldschmidt's algorithm, can achieve low latencies. However, these implementations serialize multiply, divide, and square root operations through a single pipeline, which can lead to low throughput. While this hardware sharing yields low size requirements for baseline implementations, lower-latency versions require many times more area. For these reasons, multiplicative implementations are best suited to cases where subtractive methods are precluded by area constraints, and modest performance on divide and square root operations is tolerable. Subtractive algorithms, exemplified by radix-4 SRT and radix-16 SRT, can be made to execute in parallel with other floating-point operations.},

The proposed method is thoroughly compared to many other methods currently in use, including several heuristics and pruning algorithms. The results are encouraging, indicating that it is time to shift our focus from suboptimal practices to efficient search methods, to tune the parameters of neural networks.},

These models can feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input.},

To balance selection pressure and population diversity is an important issue of designing GA. This paper proposes a novel hybridization of GA and tabu search (TS) to address this issue. The proposed method embeds the key elements of TS—tabu restriction and aspiration criterion—into the survival selection operator of GA. More specifically, the tabu restriction is used to prevent inbreeding for diversity maintenance, and the aspiration criterion is activated to provide moderate selection pressure under the tabu restriction. The interaction of tabu restriction and aspiration criterion enables survivor selection to balance selection pressure and population diversity. The experimental results on numerical and combinatorial optimization problems show that this hybridization can significantly improve GAs in terms of solution quality as well as convergence speed. An empirical analysis further identifies the influences of the TS strategies on the performance of this hybrid GA.},

frequently used as a measure of population neuronal activity. However,
relating such measurements to underlying neuronal behaviour and
connectivity is non-trivial. To help study this link, we developed the
Virtual Electrode Recording Tool for EXtracellular potentials (VERTEX). We
first identified a reduced neuron model that retained the spatial and
frequency filtering characteristics of extracellular potentials from
neocortical neurons. We then developed VERTEX as an easy-to-use Matlab
tool for simulating LFPs from large populations ({$>$}100,000 neurons). A
VERTEX-based simulation successfully reproduced features of the LFPs from
an in vitro multi-electrode array recording of macaque neocortical tissue.
Our model, with virtual electrodes placed anywhere in 3D, allows direct
comparisons with the in vitro recording setup. We envisage that VERTEX
will stimulate experimentalists, clinicians, and computational
neuroscientists to use models to understand the mechanisms underlying
measured brain dynamics in health and disease.},
