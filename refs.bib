Using high-performance computing, we systematically carry out parameter space explorations, fit and validate the brain model against the patient's empirical stereotactic EEG (SEEG) data and demonstrate how to develop novel personalized strategies towards therapy and intervention.},

	abstract = {Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient’s virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.},

Testing our software in a model of a rat neocortical slice, we determine

	abstract = {With rapidly advancing multi-electrode recording technology, the local
field potential (LFP) has again become a popular measure of neuronal
activity in both research and clinical applications. Proper understanding
of the LFP requires detailed mathematical modeling incorporating the
anatomical and electrophysiological features of neurons near the recording
electrode, as well as synaptic inputs from the entire network. Here we
propose a hybrid modeling scheme combining efficient point-neuron network
models with biophysical principles underlying LFP generation by real
neurons. The LFP predictions rely on populations of network-equivalent
multicompartment neuron models with layer-specific synaptic connectivity,
can be used with an arbitrary number of point-neuron network populations,
and allows for a full separation of simulated network dynamics and LFPs.
We apply the scheme to a full-scale cortical network model for a ∼1 mm2
patch of primary visual cortex, predict laminar LFPs for different network
states, assess the relative LFP contribution from different laminar
populations, and investigate effects of input correlations and neuron
density on the LFP. The generic nature of the hybrid scheme and its public
implementation in hybridLFPy form the basis for LFP predictions from other
and larger point-neuron network models, as well as extensions of the
current application with additional biological detail.},

first identified a reduced neuron model that retained the spatial and
frequency filtering characteristics of extracellular potentials from
neocortical neurons. We then developed VERTEX as an easy-to-use Matlab
tool for simulating LFPs from large populations ({\textgreater}100,000 neurons). A
VERTEX-based simulation successfully reproduced features of the LFPs from
an in vitro multi-electrode array recording of macaque neocortical tissue.
Our model, with virtual electrodes placed anywhere in 3D, allows direct
comparisons with the in vitro recording setup. We envisage that VERTEX
will stimulate experimentalists, clinicians, and computational
neuroscientists to use models to understand the mechanisms underlying
measured brain dynamics in health and disease.},
