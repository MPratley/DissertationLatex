\section{Scope of this Review}
TODO: justify the exclusion of certain schools. 
The academic schools that study and debate the inner workings and logistics of
the human mind are many in number, and it is outside the scope of this project
to summarise all of them in detail. Thus, we must first identify the main themes
of study that are most prevalent, and decide which of those are relevant to
the question at hand. 

If one were to consider a brain as analogous to a computer, where the memories
of the brain are its hard drive, it is these memories that an emulation of a
brain would require to be considered a continuation of a being. [List schools,
explain why structure is relevant and why it's the focus]
\autocite{eichenbaum_cognitive_2011}.
