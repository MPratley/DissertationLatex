\section{Measuring spiking patterns across the network}

-Mark certain neurons as recording
-This can be done as a boolean flag on the neuron to tell it to keep a time
trace of its potential, or by inserting measurement objects into the simulation.
These measurement objects can take the form of 

\section{Comparing spiking patterns between two networks.}

\subsection{Hamming Distance}
Treating spikes as a binary on-off at a given point in time, it is possible to
calculate the hamming distance between two network spiking patters. 

\subsection{Kulbach-Leibler Divergence}
