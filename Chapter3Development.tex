In order to better understand the fundamentals of computational neuroscience, I
am taking a "from scratch" approach to building the simulation used in this
project. While taking this approach has increased the time required for me to run simulation experiments, this has allowed me to build confidence in my
understanding of the maths and models that are commonly used in the wider
computational neuroscience community.
