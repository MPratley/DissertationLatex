\section{Concurrent Programming}

Concurrent programming is a necessity to run large scale models of networks
within a reasonable time. CITE A PERF PAPER. Explain the conclusion of paper.

\subsection{Concurrency vs Parallelism}

Concurrency doesn't necessarily mean that a program is running in parallel. A
concurrent program can run on a single core, which would involve no parallelism
despite the concurrent model of the program being unchanged.

For the purposes of simulation software, it is the parallel nature of a
concurrent program this is desirable.
