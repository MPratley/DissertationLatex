\section{Personal reflection of result success/lack thereof}

It seems likely that synaptic plasticity is the key to running simulations of
imperfectly created models that contain error, particularly in synapses where
the precise details of placement and physical composition must be resolved at
the scale of nanometres when imaging. If this is the case, then any future
technology that aims to emulate, and even predict, brain activity must ensure
that its underlying simulation is capable of capturing the nuances of synaptic plasticity.

\section{Personal reflection of whole project experience}
 - Certain concepts were intractable for quite some time 
 - concepts that I considered understood made little sense when the time came to
 develop on them 


% what we know of its function is experimentally determined, not calculated from

% interactions with other proteins, but we can't do that, and even if we could, it
% wouldn't answer all the questions we'd have about its function, because we'd
% also need to know the state of all of the proteins in the cell, and the state of
% all of the proteins in adjacent cells, and the state of global and local
% signaling proteins in the environment.

\section{What went well?}

\section{What could have been improved?}

Future work should investigate the effect of different Hebbian-Learning models
when applying error to a simulated model.
