\section{Modelling mathematics}
"In order to program this thing I must first enumerate the differential equations
that describe the functioning of Neurons in this spiking neural network."

    Mathematically, neurons can be described as hybrid systems: the state of a
    neuron evolves continuously according to some biophysical equations, which
    are typically differential equations (deterministic or stochastic, ordinary
    or partial differential equations), and spikes received through the synapses
    trigger changes in some of the variables. \autocite{brette_simulation_2007}

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:LIF_RC}
        \frac{d V}{d t} = -\frac{V}{\tau_L} + \frac{I(t)}{C},

    \begin{equation}\label{eq:integ_LIF_RC_VL}
        V(t)= \frac{1}{C} \int_{0}^{t} e^{-\frac{(t-s)}{\tau_L}} I(s) ds
    \end{equation}
    $C$ is the membrane capacity, $g_L$ is the leak conductance and $V_L$ is the leak reversal potential.
