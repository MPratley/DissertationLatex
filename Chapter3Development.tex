\chapter{Design, Development and Methodology}

In order to better understand the fundamentals of computational neuroscience, I
am taking a "from scratch" approach to building this project. While this
increases the time required to run simulation experiments, this approach allows
me to build confidence in my understanding of the maths and models that are
commonly used in the wider computational neuroscience community.
