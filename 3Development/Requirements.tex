    \item \textbf{Spiking neural network is the target emulation layer}
    Justification should cite imaging requirements and state that this is an
    appropriate level of abstraction to answer the question of this
    dissertation. Refer to the table of emulation layers in lit review.
    \item \textbf{Requirement 2.} Reasoning for requirement two.
    \item \textbf{Requirement 3}
